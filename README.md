# COVID-19-Finder
We are a group of 2 students from the National College of Informatics "Grigore Moisil" Brasov, passionate about computer science, full of enthusiasm and goodwill üòä.
Our names are Razvan and Andrei and we are excited to present our current project.
This project is INDEPENDENT of any institute or company. It is both technically and conceptually, from A to Z designed by us.
This INDEPENDENT project is a mobile application, developed due to current circumstances (COVID-19 epidemic).
Credits for the design go to Dragos Paul Ciofalau.

The purpose of this app is to prevent COVID-19 infection, protecting us and people with whom we interact.
